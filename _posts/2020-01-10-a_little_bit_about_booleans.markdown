     Boolean logic or Boolean algebra was created by an English mathematician named Charles Boole.  Born in 1815, he became the family breadwinner, as his fatherâ€™s shoemaking business was in decline. Even though he was nearly completly self-taught he became a teacher at the age of sixteen. At the age of twenty, he opened his own school. His two main focuses were differential equations and algebraic logic, and most well-known for his book *The Laws of Thought*.  He was awarded the first gold prize for mathematics from the Royal society. He also became the first professor of mathematics at Queen's college at cork, despite having never gone to university. 
      
			How this applies to computer science and programming, is that Boolean logic breaks everything in to two categories True and False, or put more simple 1's and 0's.  Booleans help us with control flow, as an example I will use the one right out of our lesson:
			
			If I am tired, then I will take a nap. 
			
			You could also invert the perspective like in this example:
      If it is true that I am tired, then I will take a nap. If it is false that I am tired, then I won't take a nap.

    Control flow is predicated on these true-or-false Boolean values. The adjectives "truthy" and "falsey" are a programming convention for describing the state of being true and the state of being false. What this example amounts to is this: we want to be able to use non-Boolean values in a Boolean context; we want to be able to say, "if a certain statement evaluates too true (or is "truthy"), then execute these certain lines of code.
		
		There are also some things that help us with true and false statements and they are Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT are the ones I have used the most so far. An example of AND would be that if both "a" and "b" are the true then the statement is true. In contrast for OR if "a" or "b" is true the statement is true, they both don't have to be true for the statement to be true. The last operator NOT is just an inverse, so true would identify as false and false would identify as true. One commonly used example of Booleans would be when you are doing a web search. You might search Peter Parker, and you might get a mix of results like Peter Dinklage, and Parker Posey, but you if you were to search Peter and Parker you would get an exact match for your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.
