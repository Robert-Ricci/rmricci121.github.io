I'm going to go way back to start this story. When I was fourteen, my family moved from Pittsburgh to a new town. My sister actually ended staying with my grandparents so she could finish eighth grade. The day my dad enrolled me in high school, I had to stay at our new house so I could wait for a utility person, to install something, I believe it was the phone (he never showed up). So my dad in his infinite wisdom, signed me up for C+. At the time I had no idea what it was. I had come from a smaller school, which didn't have much in the ways of computers. I wasn't super excited about it, but I took the class none the less, and hated it. The teacher was boring, and wasn’t very good at explaining anything in a way you could pick up. The class switched to visual basic about half way through the year, which I did enjoy more. The class left such a distaste for coding, that I didn’t take any computer classes, until my senior year. 
         
That year was the first year they offered web mastering. Which peaked my interest, I was starting to get a taste for computers again. Mrs. Crowley was the computer teacher, an older woman, which I thought at the time was weird, she always seemed as though she was learning what to do at the same time we were. The class started with Microsoft front page, a web building program, which I later found out, didn't always translate to real world websites. As I created a website as my senior project, when I went to port it over, nothing ligned up, and i had to do it all from scratch.  Then later went on to actual html. That's wear it got fun, I remember being one of the only kids actually doing the work, and then I would just put everyone’s name on it. Towards the end of the year, Mrs. Crowley and I would work out the problems together. I was also taking PC repair and networking (which basically meant we were playing games on networked computers), so I spent a lot of time with her, and I think she could tell I was really into it. 
				 
Come graduation, I had some really tuff decisions to make. I had been working in restaurants for about two years, and really enjoyed the work. I hadn't done very well on my SAT's, due to having strep the day I took them (or at least that’s my excuse). There was a culinary school in Pittsburgh, that I had tested into, and ultimately ended up going. I don't regret my choice, I've made a lot of great friends, I met my wife, and now have two amazing kids. I have a pretty good job, but I'm not entirely happy. I've been looking for something I could do, that I know I would enjoy.  I like the feeling I get when writing code. I feel like I'm creating something, that people will enjoy. Not to mention I've been beating up my body for eighteen years now, and I think it’s ready for some lighter impact.
